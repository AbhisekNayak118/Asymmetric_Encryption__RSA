## Asymmetric_Encryption__RSA
The most known encryption algorithm

What is RSA encrption algorithm exactly is ?
So idea behind RSA is to factorize large numbers(Prime numbers), which is really difficult to perform. As it's asymmetric encryption, the public key consist of 2 numbers out of which one is output of multiplication of 2 large prime numbers and same goes for the private key.
**Attack vectors or threat vector:** If someone factorizes the large numbers, then private key is compromised and thus the entire encrypted channel is disrupted.
**Possible solution:**  Making the key size stronger(probably doubling or tripling it), may reduce the chance of attack.
